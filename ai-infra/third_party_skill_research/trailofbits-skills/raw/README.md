## Installation

### Claude Code Marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add trailofbits/skills
```

### Browse and Install Plugins

```
/plugin menu
```

### Codex

Codex supports Claude plugin marketplaces directly, so this repository does not need Codex-specific sidecar metadata.

Install the marketplace with:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add trailofbits/skills
codex plugin list
codex plugin add <plugin-name>@trailofbits
```

### Local Development

To add the marketplace locally (e.g., for testing or development), navigate to the **parent directory** of this repository:

```
cd /path/to/parent  # e.g., if repo is at ~/projects/skills, be in ~/projects
/plugins marketplace add ./skills
```
